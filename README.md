# Toxic-Spans-Detetection-
Toxic Spans Detection using BERT

Toxic Spans Detection using BERT is a Python-based project that utilizes BERT, a powerful transformer-based model, to identify toxic spans within a given text. This project is useful in various applications such as online content moderation and sentiment analysis, where identifying toxic language is crucial.

## Key Features

Preprocessing: The provided code includes preprocessing techniques to handle special characters, whitespace, and unknown tokens, ensuring compatibility with BERT's input requirements.

BERT-based Classifier: The project utilizes a BERT-based classifier to predict the toxicity probability for each token in the text.

Threshold-based Span Detection: A threshold mechanism is used to determine whether a token is toxic or non-toxic. Toxic spans are identified by grouping consecutive toxic tokens.

Evaluation Metrics: Metrics such as F1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy are calculated to evaluate the performance of the toxic spans detection.
Usage

## To use this project, follow these steps:

1.Install the required dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
2.Preprocess the input text and convert it into tokenized format suitable for BERT input.
3.Fine-tune the BERT model on a labeled dataset of toxic spans.
4.Use the trained model to predict toxic spans in new texts, using the threshold mechanism.
5.Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics like F1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy.

Refer to the provided code examples and documentation for detailed instructions on each step.
